## 3.2.1

### Patch Changes

- f8f09bd: ðŸ”§ prevent duplicate piece IDs in state transitions

  Addresses race conditions in rapid `load()` calls where same piece
  type/color could receive identical IDs, breaking game state integrity.

  - `applyCanonicalToMissingIds` used flawed conflict detection
  - Arata moves assigned same ID to both board and hand pieces
  - Race conditions during rapid state transitions

  Fixed core ID assignment logic with `Set`-based conflict tracking
  rather than real-time array scanning. Balanced two requirements:

  **Stability**: Preserve IDs across close FEN states (critical for UX)
  **Uniqueness**: Ensure no duplicate IDs ever persist in system

  - `ensureUniqueIdsLenient()`: Minimal fixes, preserves stability
  - `ensureUniqueIds()`: Complete reassignment for canonical states
  - `checkForDuplicateIds()`: Detection without modification

  Arata moves now maintain hand piece ID stability while giving
  board pieces new IDs, eliminating the duplicate scenario without
  breaking expected behavior.

## 3.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9e50c6e: ðŸ†” add stable piece ID tracking system

  Implements deterministic piece IDs to enable reliable piece tracking
  across moves without breaking the existing API.

  **State-based preservation over FEN parsing**: Initially used FEN strings
  to track previous state, but this caused ID corruption during moves.
  Switched to storing full `ParsedFEN` state with IDs to maintain stability.

  **Optional `id` field**: Added to `Piece` and `HandPiece` interfaces as
  optional to maintain backward compatibility. No existing code breaks.

  **Canonical assignment with move detection**: Uses position-based sorting
  for deterministic base IDs, then preserves moving piece identity through
  sophisticated move detection between game states.

  - **ID format**: `{color}-{pieceType}-{number}` (e.g., `w-å…µ-2`, `b-å¸¥-1`)
  - **Move detection**: Analyzes board state changes to identify single moves
  - **Preservation logic**: Maintains IDs for non-moving pieces by position,
    assigns preserved ID to moving piece at destination
  - **Canonical fallback**: Complex state changes use position-based assignment

  **Memory**: Stores additional `#previousState` but enables perfect stability
  **Complexity**: Move detection adds logic but prevents ID drift entirely
  **Performance**: Minimal impact due to efficient piece matching algorithms

  The system provides deterministic, stable piece tracking while maintaining
  full API compatibility and adding comprehensive test coverage.

## 3.0.5

### Patch Changes

- 818c674: prevent history for resetting when calling load(fen)

## 3.0.4
